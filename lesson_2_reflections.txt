What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git creats a new empty repository and lists all the untracked files in 
	it if there any. If the Repo is empty then it show a fatal error saying
	something about 'HEAD' cause there is no 'HEAD'. 'HEAD' is always pointing

	for you. YOU should creat commits.
