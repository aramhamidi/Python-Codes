1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    As soon as possible. It has so many benefits:
      a. I can access it any where that I have internet access.
      b. I can share it with other people.
      c. What ever happens to my local machine, I always have the most recent copy
         of it on Github, if I push frequently.
      d. People can collaborate with me using Github.
      e. Version control! Yes.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Since pulling from the remote repo may be overwritting all the changes
    I have made in my local repository.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branche: branching happens on a single Repository. It can be on github or local machin.
	Fork: fork only happens on Github server. It doesn't have anything to do with local
		repos. 
	Clone: Clone on the other hand is simply copy. this copy can be made from a Github
		repo to a local repo, or from a local repo to another local repo. Basically
		clone can be done between any two repos.
	I will not use one for another! Each one has it's own purposes.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I am not so sure, but probably it means to keep track of all the changes
    we made localy since the last update we pulled from remote.
