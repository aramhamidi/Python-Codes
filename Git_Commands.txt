Compare two commits, printing each line that is present in one commit but not the other.

	git diff will do this. It takes two arguments - the two commit ids to compare.
	git diff considers the first argument as the "original", and the second argument
	as the "new" version, so additions are lines present in the second argument but
	not the first.

Temporarily reset all files in a directory to their state at the time of a specific commit.
